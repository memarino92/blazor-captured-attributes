# blazor-captured-attributes

This repo accompanies a blog post I wrote at [michealmarino.dev](https://www.michaelmarino.dev/articles/captured-attributes).

It was generated by running the command `dotnet new blazor -e` with the .NET 8 runtime.

This project uses TailwindCSS for styling. To generate the styles for the project, you will need Node installed on your system, and then install dependencies by running `npm install` from the root of the project. You should only need to do this once.

Once the dependencies have been installed, you can start the dev server by running the `dotnet watch` command, which will generate the necessary styles and run the app.
